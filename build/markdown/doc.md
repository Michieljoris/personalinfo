####Introduction
Pave the Way works with families and their relatives with a disability to develop and
safeguard their vision and to encourage planning for a good life now and in the
future.

One strategy that many families have found helpful is to involve other people in their
lives and in the lives of their family members with a disability. Through this
involvement, other people will gain a richer understanding of the family who in turn,
will gain support in their decisions and planning for a better life for their family
member.

**A useful tool that can be used to increase this understanding is for families
to develop a document of detailed personal information about their family
member with a disability.** In some families, the person themselves, will be able
to speak through the document with their own voice, whereas other families may
have to write on behalf of their family member.

The ideas presented here are a guide only. It is important to include information
relevant to each individual and to make your document as personalised as possible.
Whichever way the document is compiled, it is essential that the true essence of the
person with disability is captured.

> *Jason and Claire are very private people without a family network around them.
They recently moved to Queensland and English is not their first language. They
would very much like to become more involved in their local community and
have the opportunity for others to get to know their daughter better. However,
because of some language difficulties and because they are quite shy people,
they find it difficult to open up to others and have not met many people since
their move. To ask other people to become involved in their lives and help them
in their decision making around their young daughter with a disability is a
rather daunting prospect. However they do feel that they could introduce their
daughter to others through the use of written information and photos.
Compiling a document of personal information would be a good first step in
involving others in their lives.*

####Benefits of such a resource
This resource will serve a number of different purposes. It can be used in a very
practical way to save your family time and effort but it also has the potential to
greatly enrich the life of your family member with a disability.

1. It can **deepen others’ understanding** of your family member and can act
as an aid for important people in their lives to get to know about them more
quickly.

2. It can be a **way of sharing your vision** for your family member
with others.

3. It can present a **positive picture** of your family member and can be a
useful way to introduce them to others - new friends, support workers, circle
members.
> “You control the information that is entered into the pages and
therefore you can have either a positive or negative impact on how
others see your child!” (Janet Klees)

4. It can assist with record keeping. This saves time and emotional energy,
and reduces the need for the repetition of information. (Although time and
energy will be required to ensure that what is written is kept
updated.)

5. It provides up-to-date factual emergency information that can be readily
found when needed.

6. It can assist with developing consistency between agencies if your
family member is involved with a number of different support agencies. (You
do need to allow for people to be seen differently in different circumstances
and it is important to be careful about who needs to know what.)

7. It puts important information in writing for paid support people which
can assist them to get to know more about your family member. (Of course
it is important to insist that paid support people take the time to read these
documents.)

8. It is a useful tool to impart written information to professionals – e.g.
health practitioners, therapists, teachers, hospital staff.

9. It can be used as a journal of decision making and could reflect why
certain decisions have been made, especially in the situation where
parents/family members are constantly making decisions on behalf of their
family member.


<div id="look"></div>
####What will it look like?
Everyone’s document will look different but the following suggestions may help
when you are thinking about the organisation of the information. It is important
when compiling the document, to consider how the formatting and presentation can
best enable you to find information easily and quickly.

######*Some ideas for the format:*
* Series of A4 pages in plastic sleeves in a loose-leaf folder.
* Card system.
* Computer file.
* DVD presentation.
* A combination of these

######*Some ideas for organising the information:*
* Start with a positive introduction to the person – first impressions count!
* Use an index or tabs to enable you to easily find information.
* Organise the document for the easy deletion and addition of information.
*(Remember that this will be a constantly changing document.)*
* Write a table of contents at the beginning if using a written document.
* Repeat some sections under different headings if there is an overlap of
information.
* Organise it so that certain sections can easily be taken out and/or copied, to
give to relevant people such as support workers, health practitioners,
therapists, teachers. *(You might not want to give all the information to
everyone.)*
* Think about how the content in each section might have a different emphasis
dependent on the intended recipient. For example, the language used for
writing for a friend may be different from that intended for a doctor.
* Keep copies of some sections in different areas of the house, as a useful
guide to support workers. *(Keep in mind how best to do this discreetly,
considering that this is a home, rather than someone else’s workplace.)*
* Consider making copies of a lift out of emergency information and make sure
that people know how to quickly access this information.
* Personalise the document by adding photos, drawings, stories etc. This will
help to give a clearer sense of the essence of the person and introduce them
in a positive light. *(You may like to include photos of your family member
involved in a wide range of activities with different people.)*
* Write some sections in the first person which will make the document more
powerful.
> Be creative! Remember that this is a unique and intensely personal
document.

<div id="strategies"></div>
####Strategies for developing this resource
Developing this document will be an on-going and ever-evolving project. In the first
instance, it will require a big commitment of time and effort but over time, it will
prove to be an invaluable resource.

<p> 

* If possible, talk to your family member. *(Get them to tell you about their
dreams, passions, interests etc.)*

* Have others *(e.g. family members, friends, teachers, support workers)* write
about your family member. *(What they do well; what they like about
them.)*

* If you have a support circle, each member could take one section and talk
with your family member to document some aspects of their life. This would
have a two-fold benefit as it would share the workload and also give the
circle members another opportunity to get to know your family member
better. If this is not possible, they could write about your family member
from their perspective.

* If the prospect of doing all the writing yourself is daunting, you
might like to find someone else to do the writing while you talk.

* Include an open explanation of how the document was developed. Make
it clear who has written or contributed to the various sections of the
document.

* Try a workshop style of starting – get together with other families to share
ideas for compilation.

* Do it in chunks rather than trying to tackle it all at once. *(Write the
factual/emergency information first or start with photos and stories.)*

* Back up the information!! *(Hard copy, digital copy, USB, CD, email it to
others.)*

* It is important for the information to be kept up to date – you will need to
think about how best to do this on an ongoing basis.

* Make sure others know where the information is kept.
<div id="sections"></div>
####Suggested sections/contents
#####Deepening Understanding
Although factual information may be a good starting point, it doesn’t actually tell
people who your son or daughter really is. e.g. his/her personality, emotions,
likes/dislikes, passions, skills, hobbies, leisure activities, friends and social
interactions.

Photos, drawings and personal stories can make this section come
alive! Writing this section in the first person from the viewpoint of your
family member is also a good idea.

To help others understand your family member better and more quickly, you can use
this written information as a starting point rather than having to begin such a
conversation from scratch. (You could give people your binder and ask them to read
certain sections, which you could then follow up with further
conversations.)

You could open the document with a personalised introductory statement from your
family member or, if this is not possible, you could write the statement on their
behalf with whatever level of participation they are able to
contribute.

> *My name is Emma. I am 25 years old and live at home with my family. I love
music and especially love going to concerts. I enjoy going to church with my
family every week and I am a member of the youth group. I am usually happy,
have a great sense of fun and have a great capacity for friendship. I love my
family but I find my brothers, Jason and Ben, a bit annoying at times and would
eventually like to live in a place of my own. I have some cousins around my own
age who I also enjoy spending time with.*

> *Here is some more information about me that I think you will find
interesting.*

#####Information you could include to foster deeper understanding:
(These headings can be used as a guide. They are not listed in any order of
importance. Each person’s document will be different.)
Record keeping
* What has happened in my life so far
* My hopes and dreams
* My personality/emotions
* My strengths and gifts
* My skills and abilities
* My likes and dislikes (be specific about activities, food, music, outings, sports etc)
* Things that make me feel anxious
* Things that make me feel safe/calm

*(See the Templates and Suggested Headings Section for more heading
 ideas)*
 
Include a list of names, addresses, phone numbers and their relationship to your
family member (You would also probably also include this in the emergency section
or at least have an easy to find link to this information. You may even have this as a
separate section, like an address book.)
 
* Next of kin
* Support circle members
* Friends/neighbours
* Support workers.

*(See the Templates and Suggested Headings Section for more heading
 ideas)*
 
<div id="sharing"></div>
####Sharing the Vision
It is important to clearly set out the vision you and your family member have for
them to lead a rich and meaningful life. This vision will be a description of the
desired future for your family member with a disability.

Ask yourself “What are the ingredients for a good life?”

Some things we all want in our lives:

* A safe and secure home
* Loving and meaningful relationships
* The ability to make a contribution
* The ability to make our own life choices
* Financial security
* Good health.

You will need to consider what the future will look like when you are no longer in the
life of your family member with a disability.

Some questions to consider:

* Where do I want my family member to be living/where do they want to
* live?
* How will they spend their days?
* What kind of work will they do
* Who are the people who will be in their lives?
* Who will manage their money
* Who will decide on support funding and planning?
* Who will assist them to buy food/clothing etc
* Who will help plan holidays and celebrations?
* Who will hire paid support workers?
* Who will look after their health care?

__**You may also want to include the things that you and your family
member definitely DO NOT want to happen in their life.**__

e.g.


* Your family member may not want to spend their days only in services or
* segregated settings.
* You may want to make it clear the type of situation you do not want your
family member to be living in such as an institution or group home.

*(See the Templates and Suggested Headings Section for more heading
ideas)*

<div id="recordkeeping"></div>
####Record Keeping/Emergency Information
Families lead increasingly busy lives. When there is a family member with a
disability, life becomes even more complex and time seems to be an ever
diminishing resource. Families are required to fill in multiple forms which often
require similar information e.g. Medicare number, Pension number, Private Health
Fund information. This paper work can become quite overwhelming at times so it is
very useful to have this information in one place rather than having to search
through wallets and files each time.

Also, parents are asked over and over to repeat the history of their family member
with a disability to the numerous people who come into their lives – e.g. doctors,
teachers, therapists, support staff. If all of this information is organised and
documented, it makes the transfer of information much easier and less time
consuming.

######Personal information
The following is some of the information to consider including:

	Address                   Blood Type                  Eye Colour
	Passport Number           Medicare Number             Solicitor
	Power of Attorney         Health Care Card Number     Telephone Numbers         
	Current Height            Hair Colour                 Disability Pension Number 
	Private Health Cover      Accountant                  Health Care Directive     
	18 Plus Card              Date of Birth               Current Weight 
	Citizenship               Tax File Number             Birth Certificate 
	Pharmacy                  Bank Account Details 
	
######Medical information

When a child is born with a disability, the family has a lot to cope with and at times
it all seems overwhelming, especially if there are significant medical issues to deal
with. Documenting procedures is the last thing on most parents’ minds as they try
to cope with the emotional turmoil and the physical demands that having a sick child
entails. However, later it can become apparent that documenting each medical
procedure would have been very worthwhile and would make life much easier in the
future.

*(See the Templates and Suggested Headings Section for more heading
 ideas)*
 
> It is very useful to have the details of any medical issues well
  documented.
  
> Robert was born 9 weeks premature and weighed only 940 grams. He was put
straight on a ventilator when it was discovered that he had a medical condition
that meant he had no opening in both nostrils. He was first operated on at 2 days
old and in his first 2 years, all of which he spent in hospital, he had numerous
operations and medical interventions. At the time, his parents were only
concerned with his survival and were also trying to cope with their grief as it was
discovered that there were many other medical complications. In subsequent
years he continued to require many surgical procedures and frequent
hospitalisation. His parents were repeatedly asked by the many doctors who
were involved with Robert, about the various medical procedures that had taken
place. They could not remember them all and felt quite inadequate that they did
not have a complete record of his medical situation. With the freedom of
information act that is now in place, his parents could legitimately seek out this
information from the hospital if it is still available 22 years later, but this is a
daunting proposition and one which they feel some reluctance to do.

It can be quite emotionally draining for parents to have to continually explain to
people, including health care professionals, the details of their child’s disability and
how this impacts upon them. If all this information is well documented, this
information can be handed to the doctor/occupational therapist/physiotherapist etc
and then all the parent has to do is answer their questions.

Diagnostic information is also helpful in medical emergencies.

The following is some of the medical information to consider
including:

* Medical diagnosis/medical issues
* Contact details for current doctors/specialists/dentist/therapists/pharmacist
* Current medications/dosage/strength/where kept/when and how to be
* administered
* Medication supply/pharmacy
* Vaccinations
* Medications used in the past – this is sometimes helpful for doctors when
* deciding on a course of treatment
* Reactions to medications/allergies/any medications that MUST NOT be taken
* Medical appointments
* Medical history/medical records/hospitalisations
* Past doctors
* Preferred hospital
* Health precautions/health alerts.

######Daily routines
All parents worry about what will happen to their children if they are not there to
look after them. They realise the need to put procedures into place to ensure their
children’s safety and well being in the worst case scenario that something should
happen to them. Many people feel that they can rely on their extended family and
friends to step in and often they include their wishes about who they would like to
look after their children, when they are writing their wills. This concern is magnified
for parents who have sons and daughters with a disability as the care needs are
often highly complex. Also, to add to the difficulty, their family member with a
disability may not be able to easily communicate their wishes.

> Emma did a wonderful job looking after her son, 8 year old Jake, who had a
highly complex weekly routine. Because Emma was so familiar with all of the
routines that she had set in place for her son, even her husband was not fully
aware of all of the information because Emma had it all in her head e.g. If the
taxi didn’t turn up on time to take him to school, she knew who to ring; she
knew which medications to give him each day etc but if she wasn’t there, no-one
else really knew the full extent of what to do. Whenever Emma had to go away
for a few days, she left detailed notes for the rest of the family outlining exactly
what to do each day, even details such as what needed to be packed into his bag
for school. These notes were then destroyed when she returned home and she
once again picked up the full responsibility of Jake’s daily routines. When the
family started a support circle , they said that the first thing she needed to do
was to document in detail what was needed to support Jake on a daily basis, so
that others could step in if she was not around. Although this task was quite
onerous for her, once completed it actually took a great weight from Emma’s
mind as she knew that others would now know what the daily routines were,
including what medications to give her son.

Think about what a typical week looks like. Of course, there may be no such thing
as a typical week but there may be some routines on certain days. Set out the
weekly routine, giving specific details about what typically happens each day both
within and outside the home and details of who is involved in these activities. (This
may need to be continually updated.)

*(See the Templates and Suggested Headings Section for more heading
 ideas)*
 
> It is very useful to have the details of daily routines set out
  clearly.
  
#####Contacts for daily activities
Often a person with a disability has contacts with many different places and
professionals. It is very useful to have readily accessible information in one place
rather than searching for information.

The contact details for support workers could also be included in this
section.

#####Personal care information:
* Diet: likes/dislikes/food allergies
* Eating: is assistance needed?/food preferences/any special equipment
*       needed?
* Drinking: is assistance needed?/any special equipment needed?
* Toileting: is assistance needed?/timing?/are pads required?
* Safety: at home – in the kitchen, bathroom etc
*         In the community – road sense, awareness of danger, strangers
*          etc
* Personal Hygiene: how much and what type of assistance is needed with this? (e.g.
*                 bathing, teeth cleaning, toileting, dressing.)
* Sleeping: routines?
* Mobility: what support is needed?
* Daily Health care: any special needs?
* 
#####Communication/behaviour
It is important for others to understand how your family member communicates
their needs, particularly if they do not use standard speech. People also need to
know how to interpret their communication and to know of any ways that
communication can be fostered.

Possible information to include:

* What is my preferred method of communication?
* How do I indicate how I am feeling?
* How do I receive communication?
* What is my literacy/reading ability?
* What is the level of my telephone skills?
* What do changes in my behaviour indicate?
* How do I communicate if I am under stress?

#####Financial and legal arrangements
Include details of wills, executor, trusts (estate planning), trustees, power of
attorney, health directive and guardianship arrangements. (Make sure the trustees
are informed.) Include details of who is taking responsibility for your family
member’s financial affairs.

#####Income and funding
######Sources and accountability

* This can at times be quite complex and the contact people in departments
change frequently. This information will need to be regularly kept up to
date.
* It would be useful to outline what funding is currently being received,
from what sources and how it is being used.

######Budget considerations
* Can the person manage their own finances?
* What assistance do they need with this?
* Who provides this assistance?
* What safeguards have been put in place around the person’s finances?

<div id="emergency"></div>
####Emergency Plan
* This information needs to be easily found.
* It may need to include some of the information that was also included in
the personal details section.
* You would need to distribute this information to people who you would
need to rely on in an emergency.
* It would be beneficial to set out a step by step plan.

	+ Who needs to be contacted and contact details?
	+ Where to find essential information such as medical records,
	medication, daily schedule, wills etc.
	+ Details of who would provide accommodation support.
	+ Details of who would provide financial support.
	+ Details of who would make health care decisions.

*(See the Templates and Suggested Headings Section for more heading
 ideas)*
 
> One way to work this out may be to imagine that you have the opportunity to travel
overseas for three months.

> Who would take care of all the things you normally do?

<div id="expectations"></div>
####Expectations of Support Workers
Sometimes it is difficult for parents to verbally outline all of their expectations of
support workers who come into their homes or who support their son/daughter in
the community. A document outlining what is expected can be a useful tool to help
workers support your family member in the way you would. It can make this
communication easier but it is important to be very specific about what you expect.
As well as making sure they really understand your family member, you would also
need to include practical information such as where they can find things in the
house, safety issues etc.

Much of this information could be copied from other sections of your
document.
